ECMAScript 6 introduces a whole host of new features into Javascript. With the final spec having been set, let's review some of the new features.

### For-Of loops

The **For-Of loop** is the new ES6 way of looping through an array. It doesn't replace **For-If** loops, as they're intended for looping over objects and were never meant to be used on arrays. The **For-Of loop** will iterate over the values of the array, not the properties/index like an **For-If** loop does.

    var fruit = ["apple","banana","cake"];

    for (let f of fruit) {
      console.log(f);
    }
    > apple
      banana
      cake
      
The main benefits of **For-Of** loops are:
* can use break, continue, return unlike in ES5 forEach loops
* avoids the problems with enumerable properties on the prototype chain 

The **For-Of** loop doesn't just work on arrays though, it will work on all array-like objects which hold data. You can use them to iterate of a NodeList from querying the DOM, and you can iterate over a String a character at a time.

    for (var x of "abc") {
        console.log(x);
    }
    > a
      b
      c
